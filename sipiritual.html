<h3>Mathura and Vrindavan</h3>
<blockquote>Krishna is worshipped in hundreds of temples across the world. Some of them hold a special significance as they are associated with the life of the Lord and some others are important because of their historicity and the aura of spirituality associated with them. A few temples stand out conspicuously above other places of Krishna worship as they are directly associated with the events in the Lord’s life. They are generally located at Mathura, the place of Krishna’s birth, Vrindavana, where he spent most of his childhood days and Dwarka where he spent most of his adult life. Sri Krishna appeared over five thousand years ago in Mathura as the eighth child of Devaki and Vasudeva. Kansa was the king of Mathura and maternal uncle of lord Krishna .The place of His birth is known as Sri Krishna JanmaBhumi.</blockquote>

<h3>Kashi Vishwanath</h3>
<blockquote>The Kashi Vishwanath Temple is a famous Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Shiva. It is located in Vishwanath Gali of Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh in India. The temple stands on the western bank of the holy river Ganga, and is one of the twelve Jyotirlingas, the holiest of Shiva temples. The main deity is known by the names Shri Vishwanath and Vishweshwara (IAST: Vishveshvara or Vishveshvur) literally meaning Lord of the Universe. Varanasi was called Kashi ("shining") in ancient times, and hence the temple is popularly called Kashi Vishwanath Temple.</blockquote>
