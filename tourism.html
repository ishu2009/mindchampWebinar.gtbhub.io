<h1>About Delhi Tourism</h1>
</div>
<blockquote style="color:white;"><strong>Delhi is both a union territory within India,
as well as a city, and features two very different worlds: New Delhi and Old Delhi.
The former, inaugurated by the British in 1931 to serve as the imperial capital,
is the nation's modern capital and seat of government, while Old Delhi is considered
by many as the symbolic heart of the greater area</strong></blockquote>
<blockquote style="color:white;"><strong>
Things to see and do in Delhi and New Delhi are plentiful and
include experiencing its diverse arts and crafts industry, its many
magnificent monuments, and countless performing arts venues.
The area is also well known for its excellent cuisine, which includes
delicacies from every corner of India. Delhi is also a shopper's paradise
with numerous bazaars and markets,
including Chandni Chowk, the country's most famous commercial area.

<blockquote style="color:white;"><em>The beautiful Red Fort (Lal Qila) was built by Shah Jahan in 1648 and served as the seat of Mughal power until 1857.<br>
This stunning structure, with its tall, red sandstone walls covers an area of more than two square kilometers,
the entirety of which is crescent shaped and surrounded by a moat.<br>
The impressive main entrance, the Lahore Gate, is so named as it faces towards Lahore in Pakistan,
while the even grander Delhi Gate was used by the emperor for ceremonial processions.<br>
Entering through the Lahore Gate, visitors reach Chhatta Chowk, a 17th-century covered bazaar
where items such as silks, jewelry, gems, and silverware can be purchased, along with souvenirs and food items.<br>
The Naubat Khana within the Red Fort once housed the musicians who played for the emperor,
and its fine galleries still contain many interesting musical instruments such as kettledrums, gongs, and cymbals.
Diwan-i-Am, the Hall of Public Audiences, where the emperor would receive his subjects,
is also worth seeing for its stunning white marble.</em></blockquote>
